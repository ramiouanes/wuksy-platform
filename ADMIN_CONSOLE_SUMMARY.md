## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Route Protection
```typescript
// Public routes (no auth required)
- /
- /coming-soon
- /admin/login
- /api/subscribe
- /api/admin/login
- /api/admin/logout
- /api/admin/check

// Protected admin routes (auth required)
- /admin
- /api/admin/* (all admin APIs)

// Protected app routes (auth required)
- /app/*
- All other routes
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User visits `/admin/login`
2. Enters password
3. Password verified against `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var
4. Session cookie set (HTTP-only, secure in production)
5. User redirected to `/admin` dashboard
6. All subsequent requests authenticated via cookie
7. Logout clears cookie and redirects
