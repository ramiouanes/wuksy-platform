# Admin Console Setup - Fix for Supabase Data Access

## üîß Problem Fixed

The admin console wasn't showing data because it was using the **anon key** which is restricted by Row Level Security (RLS) policies. Admin routes need to use the **service role key** to bypass RLS and access all data.

## ‚úÖ What Was Updated

All admin API routes now use `createAdminClient()` which uses the service role key:
- `/api/admin/stats`
- `/api/admin/users`
- `/api/admin/subscribers`
- `/api/admin/documents`
- `/api/admin/analyses`
- `/api/admin/biomarkers`
- `/api/admin/export`
- And all detail endpoints

## üîê Required: Add Service Role Key

You need to add your Supabase **service role key** to your environment variables.

### Step 1: Get Your Service Role Key

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on **Settings** (gear icon in the left sidebar)
3. Click on **API** section
4. Find the **service_role** key (under "Project API keys")
5. Copy the key (it's the long one that starts with `eyJ...`)

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: The service role key bypasses all RLS policies. Never expose it to the client-side or commit it to version control!

### Step 2: Add to Environment Variables

Add this line to your `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# Supabase Service Role Key (KEEP SECRET - Server-side only!)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

Your `.env.local` should now look something like:

```bash
# Supabase credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...your-service-role-key

# Admin password
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# Other env vars...
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

After adding the service role key, restart your dev server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it again:
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Admin Console

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
2. Login with your admin password
3. You should now see all your data! üéâ

## üîç Verify It's Working

You should now see:
- ‚úÖ Subscriber counts and data
- ‚úÖ User data (if you have registered users)
- ‚úÖ Documents (if any have been uploaded)
- ‚úÖ Health analyses (if any exist)
- ‚úÖ Biomarkers from your database

## üîí Security Notes

### What's the Difference Between Keys?

1. **Anon Key** (Public)
   - Safe to use in client-side code
   - Respects Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Used in: Frontend, user-facing API routes

2. **Service Role Key** (Secret)
   - NEVER use in client-side code
   - Bypasses ALL RLS policies
   - Full admin access to all data
   - Used in: Admin API routes only

### Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Keep service role key in `.env.local` only
- Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (should already be there)
- Use service role key only in server-side API routes
- Protect admin routes with authentication (already done via middleware)

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Never commit service role key to git
- Never send it to the client
- Never use it in client components
- Never expose it in public APIs

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Still Not Seeing Data?

1. **Check Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   # Make sure the key is set correctly
   echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   ```

2. **Restart Server**
   - Environment variables are only loaded on server start
   - Make sure you restart after adding the key

3. **Check Console for Errors**
   - Open browser dev tools (F12)
   - Check the Console tab for errors
   - Check the Network tab for failed API requests

4. **Verify Key is Correct**
   - Go back to Supabase dashboard
   - Settings ‚Üí API
   - Make sure you copied the `service_role` key (not the `anon` key)

5. **Check Supabase Tables Exist**
   - Go to Supabase dashboard
   - Table Editor
   - Verify these tables exist:
     - `email_subscriptions`
     - `users`
     - `documents`
     - `health_analyses`
     - `biomarkers`
     - `biomarker_readings`

### Error: "Missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY environment variable"

This means the environment variable isn't set. Follow Step 2 above and restart your server.

### Error: "Invalid JWT"

Your service role key might be incorrect. Double-check you copied the right key from Supabase.

## üìù Production Deployment

When deploying to production (Vercel, etc.):

1. **Add Environment Variable to Platform**
   - Go to your deployment platform settings
   - Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as an environment variable
   - Paste your service role key
   - This keeps it secure and separate from your code

2. **Vercel Example:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Add:
     - Name: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
     - Value: `your_service_role_key`
     - Environment: Production (and Preview if needed)

3. **Redeploy**
   - After adding the env var, redeploy your app
   - The admin console will now work in production

## üéØ Summary

The admin console now uses the proper authentication method to access all your Supabase data. Just add the service role key to your environment variables and restart your server.

**Need Help?** If you're still having issues after following these steps, check:
- Server console logs for errors
- Browser console for client errors
- Supabase dashboard logs
- Network tab in dev tools to see API responses

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - Admin console now properly configured for full data access!
